### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

#### I am an evolutionary ecologist using genomic and modeling tools to answer questions about local adaptation, conservation, and invasion biology.

]I am a NSF postdoctoral fellow at Colorado State University with Drs. Chris Funk (https://sites.google.com/view/funklab/) and Eric Anderson (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/contact/eric-anderson-phd). At CSU I work on questions about genetic diversity and potential for adaptation with goal of recovering greenback cutthroat trout (*Oncorhynchus clarkii stomias*), Colorado's state fish!

Prior to my time at CSU, I was a PhD student with Dr. Mark Christie's lab (https://christielab.bio.purdue.edu/) at Purdue University, where I workeed on the contemporary evolution of pink salmon (*Oncorhynchus gorbuscha*) that were introduced into the Great Lakes. Previously, I did my MS with Drs. Peter Westley and Jeff Falke at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, working on the developmental thermal biology of sockey salmon (*Oncorhynchus nerka*) in Bristol Bay, AK.

Pretty much any ecology or evolution interests me, but other projects I am working on include cryptic local adaptation and life history evolution. Read more about them on my website https://msparks1309.wixsite.com/morganmsparks.

Otherwise, I love to fish, hunt, gather, and garden, with the ultimate goal of making really good food. I have a current obsession with making pizza.
