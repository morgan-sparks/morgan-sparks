### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

#### I am an evolutionary ecologist using computational tools to answer questions about conservation and invasion biology.

Presently, I am a PhD candidate in Dr. Mark Christie's lab (https://christielab.bio.purdue.edu/) at Purdue University, where I work on the contemporary evolution of pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) that were introduced into the Great Lakes. Previously, I did my MS with Drs. Peter Westley and Jeff Falke at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, working on the developmental thermal biology of sockey salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in Bristol Bay, AK. 

Pretty much any ecology or evolution interests me, but other projects I am working on include cryptic local adaptation and life history evolution. Read more about them on my website https://msparks1309.wixsite.com/morganmsparks.

Otherwise, I love to fish, hunt, gather, and garden, with the ultimate goal of making really good food. I have a current obsession with making pizzas.
