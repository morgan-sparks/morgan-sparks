### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

#### I am a fish biologist using genomic and modeling tools to answer questions about conservation, management, and basic questions concerning aquatic organisms.

I work as a Research Fish Biologist with USDA Forest Service in the Water and Watersheds program in their Boise, ID office (https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/rmrs/programs/waterwatersheds) where my focus is on developing core knowledge, methods, and technologies that enable effective watershed management in forests and grasslands, sustain biodiversity, and maintain healthy watershed conditions.

If you have questions or research interest that overlap with these areas, particularly as they pertain to salmonid conservation and management please reach out to me at Morgan.Sparks@usda.gov

Past projects I was a part of and still continue to work on include:

- My NSF supported postdoc work at Colorado State University with Drs. Chris Funk (https://sites.google.com/view/funklab/) and Eric Anderson (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/contact/eric-anderson-phd). At CSU I work on questions about genetic diversity and potential for adaptation with the goal of recovering greenback cutthroat trout (*Oncorhynchus clarkii stomias*), Colorado's state fish!

- My PhD research in Dr. Mark Christie's lab (https://christielab.bio.purdue.edu/) at Purdue University, where I worked on the contemporary evolution of pink salmon (*Oncorhynchus gorbuscha*) that were introduced into the Great Lakes. 

Pretty much any ecology or evolution interests me, but other projects I am working on include cryptic local adaptation and life history evolution. Read more about them on my website https://msparks1309.wixsite.com/morganmsparks or on my Google Scholar page https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sMTXf4QAAAAJ&hl=en.

Otherwise, I love to fish, hunt, gather, and garden, with the ultimate goal of making really good food. I have a current obsession with making pizza.
